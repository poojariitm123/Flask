The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. Let's examine the code and its functionalities.

*1. Importing Dependencies*
The code begins by importing  the necessary dependencies for the application: Flask, request, and jsonify. Flask is a micro web framework for building web applications in Python. Request is used to handle incoming HTTP requests, and jsonify is used to convert Python objects into JSON format.

*2. Initializing the Flask Application*
The Flask application is initialized using the `Flask(_name)` statement. The `name_` variable is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module.

*3. Sample Data*
A sample data list called `books` is created. It contains three book objects, each having an ID, title, and author. This list serves as the initial set of books for the API.

*4. HTTP GET - Get all books*
A route decorator is used to define an endpoint for handling HTTP GET requests to retrieve all books. The route decorator specifies the URL path ("/books") and the HTTP method ("GET"). The `get_books` function is executed when this endpoint is accessed. It simply returns all the books in the `books` list as a JSON response using the `jsonify` function.

*5. HTTP GET - Get a specific book*
Another route decorator is used to define an endpoint for handling HTTP GET requests to retrieve a specific book. The route decorator includes a parameter `<int:book_id>` in the URL path, which allows specifying the ID of the book to retrieve. The `get_book` function is executed when this endpoint is accessed. It iterates over the `books` list and searches for a book with a matching ID. If found, the book is returned as a JSON response. If no matching book is found, a JSON response with an appropriate error message and status code 404 (Not Found) is returned.

*6. HTTP POST - Add a new book*
The next route decorator defines an endpoint for handling HTTP POST requests to add a new book. The decorator specifies the URL path ("/books") and the HTTP method ("POST"). The `add_book` function is executed when this endpoint is accessed. It extracts the book details (ID, title, and author) from the request's JSON payload and creates a new book object. The new book is then added to the `books` list. Finally, the newly added book is returned as a JSON response with status code 201 (Created).

*7. HTTP PUT - Update an existing book*
The next route decorator defines an endpoint for handling HTTP PUT requests to update an existing book. The decorator includes a parameter `<int:book_id>` in the URL path to specify the ID of the book to update. The `update_book` function is executed when this endpoint is accessed. It searches for a book with the given ID in the `books` list, updates its title and author based on the request's JSON payload, and returns the updated book as a JSON response. If no matching book is found, a JSON response with an appropriate error message and status code 404 (Not Found) is returned.

*8. HTTP DELETE - Delete a book*
The last route decorator defines an endpoint for handling HTTP DELETE requests to delete a book. It uses the `<int:book_id>` parameter in the URL path to specify the ID of the book to delete. The `delete_book` function is executed when this endpoint is accessed. It searches for a book with the given ID in the `books` list, removes it from the list, and returns a JSON response with
